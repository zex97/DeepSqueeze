# DeepSqueeze

Note: This is a fork from the MikeXydas (https://www.github.com/MikeXydas) implementation of the DeepSqueeze paper. 
Following is the README by the original author.

In this repo I attempt to reproduce the compression utility described in *[DeepSqueeze: Deep Semantic Compression for
Tabular Data](https://cs.brown.edu/people/acrotty/pubs/3318464.3389734.pdf)* by *Amir Ilkhechi, Andrew Crotty,
 Alex Galakatos, Yicong Mao, Grace Fan, Xiran Shi, Ugur Cetintemel* from Brown University.
 
 ## Demo (with sound :sound:)

 You can read the `report.pdf` for info about the original paper, my implementation, my additions and
 results.
 
 There are 3 branches in this repo:
 * `master`, used in my demo presentation
 * `experiment`, mainly used to run experiments and producing results
 * `mixture_of_experts`, since I was not able to achieve better results using 
 the Mixture of Experts architecture, I decided to keep it into a separate branch 
 reducing code complexity of the `master` and `demo` branches
 

 ## Running
 
 I suggest running DeepSqueeze in the `master` branch which is cleaned-up following 
 the steps below:
 
 1. Create a python environment. The DeepSqueeze package was developed in `python3.8`
 2. Install the requirements in `requirements.txt`
 3. Download one of the processed tables (no header, only numerical values).
    * [Corel dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qz8qI56SDfJp-JuG750aYuYyAddi63_7/view?usp=sharing)
    * [Intel Berkeley Research Lab Sensor Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JRDxmHpxT_2IpvWugBxmXKEev7xRmo2E/view?usp=sharing)
    * Monitor dataset, due to its size I have not uploaded the preprocessed version.
    You can download it [here](http://cs.brown.edu/people/acrotty/mgbench/bench1.tar.gz) and preprocess 
    it using `notebooks/preprocessing.ipynb`
 4. Compress the table with the command: 
 
 `python compress.py -i path/to/input.csv -o path/to/output/dir/ -e <error_threshold_percentage>`
 
 Note that the `-e` parameter takes a value between `[0, 100]` with suggested values being:
 `0.5, 1, 5, 10`.
 
 5.Decompress the table with the command:
 
 `python decompress.py -i path/to/compressed_tables.zip`
 
 This is the full pipeline of DeepSqueeze with some simplification 
 presented in `report.pdf`.
